# About
I created this website with React to mimic the first operating system that I ever used - Windows XP. There are links to
my resume, github, linkedin as well as one of my favorite puzzles, classic MS Paint, Spider Solitaire and minesweeper(
both of which I have spent hours on hours playing as a child). Building this website was a ton of fun and made me very
nostalgic - hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

# Credits
For both Spider and Paint, I am just using a iframe component that are going to the
websites https://www.squidbyte.com/games/spidersolitairewindowsxp/ and https://jspaint.app respectively.
